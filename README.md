Welcome to my backyard where I passionately break things 😙 

# About Me

🎓 I'm a graduate from SUNY Oswego in 2023 with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Information Science.

🎀 I work as a software engineer by day, and do passion projects by night. Or grind games.

🎸 I play guitar, cook, or bake when I have time (read: not grinding games).

💤 I want to get better at front end development and designs. Perhaps learn Rust as well.

🍨 Favorite languages: Python and C#
